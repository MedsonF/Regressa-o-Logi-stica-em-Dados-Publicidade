# Logistic Regression and Ad Click Analysis

## Description

### In this script, we use a database from a company that owns a website and analyze customer data, such as time spent on the computer or the website, and, in the end, we analyze whether they click on the advertisement or ignore it.

## Libraries required for development:

* seaborn
* scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Script Explanation:

### This script consists of a series of exercises focused on logistic regression to address a fundamental question: What leads a person to click or not click on the advertisement on our website?
### The analysis is based on coefficients identified during the study and exploratory data analysis.
